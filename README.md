Friend Finder - Node and Express Servers


Overview

In this activity, I built a compatibility-based "FriendFinder" application -- basically a dating app. This full-stack site takes in results from the users' surveys, then compares their answers with those from other users. The app will then display the name and picture of the user with the best overall match. 

This app uses Express to handle routing and has been deployed to Heroku to portray full stack functionality.

Basically the survey will have 10 questions of the user's choosing. Each answer is on a scale of 1 to 5 based on how much the user agrees or disagrees with a question.  The results to the questions will help match up the user with a compatible friend. 

Enjoy!
